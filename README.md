# blood-drop-bot
A Discord Bot

This is setup to run off of glitch which required some extra code to keep the bot active 24/7 and the watch file to help stop glitch from saving on every keystroke.

This is a Discord bot that will:

Send a Reminder at 3:30pm every friday  
Allow users to interact with the bot by using commands:  
!help -> will show a list of available commands  
!8ball - ask a question, and get a magic eight ball response  
!rollbones - will roll 2 6 sided dice OR you can pass a value for side of die (!rollbones 8)  
!insult - uses an api to get a random insult or randomly insult someone like !insult @NAME  
!fortune - will tell you your fortune
